# Introduction
this multi-media workshop will explore the use(s) and storing of
archives (music videos, photos, pop culture, writings, zines, etc... )
with a critique on (in)accessibility + autonomy to control our pasts’
narratives. Participants will take part in questioning and dissecting
where archives live, how they’re being used, and who has autonomy +
control over them. We will then each take part in creating our own
personal archival piece via video editing and filmmaking-- ensuring
and practicing ownership + autonomy of archival storytelling. Ending
with a reflection in the roles we play as editors, creators, and
recorders to engage in the preservation and storytelling of our past
to make sense of our present and ultimately, map out a radically
different future.
# Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
this exercise is for middle to high school age range. much of the
workshop will be exploring the internet, mobile + web platform apps
which includes knowing how to navigate the internet. you do not need
to know how to identify media in code or read code and how to edit
videos because the facilitator will teach those skills during the
workshop.
# Outcome + Goals
After this workshop, students will:
know where media archives live: both online and in public spaces
understand how archives have been historically used and the way
they're used now
learn how to retrieve media off of the internet via code-reading
learn how to accredit uses of media
learn how to do linear video editing

headphones
# Exercise Descriptions
exercise: how to create a storyboard
pass out handouts with storyboard squares and lines and present a
short presentation of how storyboards are used to predict a storyline,
an idea, a concept, and introduce the arc storyline process in
screenwriting. then, let the participants work together or alone to
conceptualize their idea onto paper. using the history of uses, who
has control and autonomy, of archives as a springboard for them

thinking about which archives they'll use and ones they're interested
in.
exercise: how to retrieve media from internet code
pass out handouts with a breakdown of the google chrome ability to
read present the code from the webpage-- handout should host visuals
for how to do so along with written instructions. then, have
participants try it out while also demonstrating it live via a
projector each step of the way. then, let participants gather their
media pieces on the internet to compile that will fit their storyboard
ideas.
exercise: how to edit video + audio in linear editing software
depending on the type of video software being used, walk through the
steps of editing a video and have students follow your steps as you
go. introduce them to importing media, cutting and trimming their
video, cropping the media to fit the frame, using filters and other
capacities. the aim of this exercise is for participants/students to
be mindful in how they're using archival media in their piece -- limit
the video to a 2-3 min length and have participants go free with where
they want to take it, which critique, observation, perspective they
want to take and so forth. in this exercise, they should already have
their storyboard and media set and a direction for the video so that
this exercise is based on experimenting with editing functions and
materializing their visions.
prompt 1: what comes to mind when i say archive? what comes to mind
when i say memory? how do you experience those two definitions in your
life? what are the possibilities to commemorate both memory and
archive in our day and age? what is my role in this?
# Vocabulary
Archive: a collection of physical and digital memories and
representations of human history and culture in the form of artifacts,
photo, objects, oral, video living usually in institutions, personal
collections, and digitally on the internet.
Accessibility: the quality and ability to use and acquire with ease
and fair playing field
Ctrl+F/Command+F: the keypads to press simultaneously to open up the
filter to find particular items on a webpage or document
JPG: jpeg is the format by which images are saved and read
MP4: mp4 is the universal format by which videos are saved and read
Linear-editing: term used in video editing where you edit videos,
sounds, images from a time point from beginning to ending in a
horizontal (linear) way

USB: a device that stores documents, files, that you can plug into
your computer and access those files. we will save our work and
archival media on our usbs.

# Reflections
In our reflection, it will serve to write down participants' thoughts
and ideas since the workshop is inspiration + critique + production
heavy. to give a break, reflections will serve as a way to decompress
all of the ideas and thoughts discussed and ways to document, as a
form of archival work, the workshop and the thoughts throughout it.
