# "Blockchain: Whatâ€™s All The Hype About?" by [Adelya](https://www/astar.app)
---
## Essential Questions
 * why is there so much hype with blockchain?
 * what/where is it?
 * how does it work?
 * why are people investing into it?
 * who can it benefit?
 * are there other blockchains than bitcoin and if so, how are they different?
 * who owns/controls the blockchain?
 * are blockchains public, private, or both? why?

## Introduction

This class will explain mechanics through a participatory workshop, no coding experience required.
It will open with a brief historical introduction and close with considerations of 
applications and bottlenecks.

Please note: 
* This is a rapidly developing, nascent technology. 
We will be using the Proof of Work consensus mechanism used by Ethereum
before their transition to Proof of Stake. 

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This class is constructed for curious blockchain beginners with none or some
experience coding. High school students 14 + . 

### Outcomes & Goals
* In this workshop we will be making human chains to replecate a blockchain. 
Some students will reprecent the blocks, other the nodes, others the gossip protocol.
We will workshop the machanics of a formation of a block, a fork, and a 51% attack.
* Students will walk away with a high level understanding of the mechanics 
that operates the blockchain as well as it's use cases and bottlenecks.

### Pacing / Duration
This class is designed for a 2 hour period.
* 30 min: historical intro
* 60 min: hands on workshop
* 30 min: critical thinking wrap up

## Materials Needed
* Whiteboard + markers
* Index cards + pens/pencils

### Exercises To Do Before Class
Look up 3 blockchain copmanies. 

## Vocab
- blockchain: a list of records linked through crytography 
- consensus: an agreement between majority (51%) of a group
- immutable: permanent
- open source: code that can be accessed without a paywall ([licensing for open sourceware](https://opensource.org/licenses))
