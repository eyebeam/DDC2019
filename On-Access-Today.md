## Essential Questions
* How might storytelling be connected to history?
* How are people’s experiences necessary to storytelling?
* In what ways might storytelling be significant to who gets to write history?
* How might storytelling and oral traditions change who has access to
keeping history and what is remembered and how?

## Introduction
In this workshop we will analyze personal experiences as important to
understanding access⎼ the impact of lacking it and what having full
access looks like in communities in 2019. Our goal is to create a short
podcast on our findings in our workshop. We will critically connect our
stories and interviews framing them to questions on US history and social
justice issues. Together, we will explore how our stories are part of the
larger narrative in US history.
