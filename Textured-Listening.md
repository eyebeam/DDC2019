## Essential Questions
* What is communication?
* How is lipreading understood?
* What shapes do lips make speaking? 

## Introduction
In this workshop students will draw the shape of their lips
pronouncing a word to stimulate how a Deaf or Hard of Hearing
person understands spoken word. This will show the nuances of
lip reading -looking at the shapes of lips making a sound, how
many teeth are being shown in a sound, etc. Students will start by
recording their mouth pronouncing a word and then will break
down their video into individual sounds so that they can see each
sound being pronounced. By the end of the workshop students
will gain awareness of their unique mouth shapes and the
challenges as well as fun of understanding speech without sound.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This is ideal for middle schoolers to the elderly. Phones or any
device for video is necessary. Access to laptops/computers to
break down the video. Reading this article or watching this video
would be a good thing to do. I will go over the video in class.

### Outcomes & Goals
In this workshop students will draw their lip shapes produced in a
spoken word.
Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of one of the
ways in which Deaf/Hard of Hearing people learn to
communicate- through lipreading.
Students will see what words look like versus what they sound
like.
Students will gain a new perspective on what communication
means.

* **6min Walk around Share + Group Photo**
* Walk around see other people’s ‘process’ photos
and final drawing
* Group Photo with everyone’s individual lip drawing
* Quick discuss about observations between clarity
of lips between colors

## Student Reflections, Takeaways & Next Steps
* Challenge with Friends: Wear headphones and with friends
guess which words are being said. One person speaks the
other person with the headphone on has to guess what the
person said.
* Find words that students hear often and repeat the lesson on
their own drawing the words out.
* Learn all about Christine Sun Kim, a Deaf artist who talks a
lot about the Deaf experience
* Presentation: Students can share their work at
#texturedlistening or #mydeafexperience on instagram. They
can post it on facebook, they can share with their friends,
doodle it on their notebooks, turn it into stickers, slap it on a
skateboard or a laptop. Whatever way they would like to.
* Reflection: Students can pay attention to how their family
members and peers talk. They can reflect on how they
themselves talk, if they mumble their lips or speak quickly or
clearly.
