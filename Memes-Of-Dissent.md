## Exercises To Do Before Class

Bring in some of your favorite memes

## Vocabulary:

* Meme: an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one
individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation.
* Medium: a non-transparent method of communication
* Culture: the customs of a nation, a people, or other social group
* Subculture: a cultural group within a larger culture, often having beliefs or interests at variance with those
of the larger culture.

## Exercise Descriptions
This is a class where we go through the history of memes and meme culture with a social justice lens. We
would take a look at memes outside of and within the USA to talk about how they may dissent to and
inform our political climate, spread sentiments, and create solidarity. Some memes that we would focus
on are pepe, leftbook, 草泥⻢, and surreal memes, asking ourselves questions such as "What are the
layers of information someone would already have to know to understand this meme?", "What makes a
meme a meme?", and "What does it mean when memes become more standard and corporate?" At the
end of the workshop, students will create their own memes about a self chosen issue.

## Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so
students are locked into one end product.
* First Steps - Create your own version of a meme that already exists
* Next Steps - Create your own original meme
* Big Steps - Study the memes that you see everyday with a critical lens. Think about what they're trying to
tell you, into what groups they try to pull you into, and what type of information they give out
* Presentation: You can share your memes on any social media sharing platform
* Reflection: How are the memes you see everyday influencing you and your ideology?

## Implementation Guidance & Teaching Reflection
Rather than presenting memes as an inherently politically active language, present it as just a language
that can be appropriated by capitalism. Emphasize that memes are a currency of emotion. Provide
examples of meme culture outside of the West to create diverse examples of how subculture intersects
with parent cultures.
